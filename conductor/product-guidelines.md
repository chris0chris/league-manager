# Product Guidelines - LeagueSphere

## Tone and Style
- **Friendly and Community-Focused:** Use language that is welcoming and reflects the flag football community. While maintaining clarity, the prose should feel accessible and encouraging.
- **Context-Specific Voice:** 
    - **Administrative Tools (Gameday Designer, Passcheck):** Use a clear, helpful, and reliable voice that instills confidence in managers and officials.
    - **Fan-Facing Tools (Liveticker):** Use a more dynamic and energetic voice that captures the excitement of the game.

## Visual Identity & UI Design
- **Clean and Data-Centric:** Focus on legibility and organization. Use a minimalist palette, clear typography, and generous spacing to make complex tables, schedules, and brackets easy to scan and understand.
- **Clarity over Flourish:** Visual elements should support the data, not distract from it.

## User Guidance & Error Prevention
- **Forgiving Actions (Undo vs. Confirm):** Prefer "Undo" mechanisms over blocking confirmation dialogs for destructive actions. Actions should be immediate, with a temporary (e.g., 10-second) window to revert the change via a non-intrusive notification (Toast).
- **Inline Validation:** Provide real-time feedback during data entry and schedule creation to catch errors early and reduce frustration.
- **Comprehensive Tooltips:** Use tooltips to explain complex business rules, eligibility requirements, or calculation logic, helping users understand the system's requirements.
- **Soft Warnings:** Highlight potential issues or optimizations (e.g., scheduling suggestions) that provide helpful context without strictly blocking user actions.

## Internationalization & Accessibility
- **High-Quality German Support:** Maintain comprehensive and accurate German translations, prioritizing the core DFFL user base.
- **Outdoor Legibility:** Consider contrast and touch target sizes for tools intended for on-field use by officials and referees.
