Flag Football Tournament Formats (for 5-8 teams):

Pool Play → Playoffs: Teams play round-robin in pools, top 50% advance to single elimination
Full Round Robin: Everyone plays everyone (5 teams = 10 games, 8 teams = 28 games)
Single Elimination: Direct knockout bracket
Double Elimination: Losers get second chance through consolation bracket
Modified Bracket: Hybrid formats with seeding from pools
